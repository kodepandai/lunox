In Laravel (using php), requests are handled by the application, and the application is terminated after each request. In Lunox (using nodejs), the application runs on an event loop, so it is not terminated but runs continuously. Therefore, it is important in Lunox to return a response or throw an exception for every request handled, to ensure that the application does not hang.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture-concepts/service-container":{"id":"architecture-concepts/service-container","title":"Service Container","description":"The Lunox Service Container is inspired by Laravel\'s service container. The basic concept is the same, but we have some limitations due to the nature of Node.js. In Laravel, we can dynamically perform dependency injection, whereas in Lunox, we must explicitly bind and resolve classes or instances.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture-concepts/service-provider":{"id":"architecture-concepts/service-provider","title":"Service Provider","description":"Lunox Service Providers follow the same concept as Laravel Service Providers.
